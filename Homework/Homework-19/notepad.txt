1.	What are closures?
Closures are the functions, which can access to variables in enclosing scope.
They have access to global variables.
Inner function variables may not be accessed outside.

2.	What is hoisting?
Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top. A variable can be used before it has been declared.
x = 5; // Assign 5 to x
elem = document.getElementById("demo"); // Find an element 
elem.innerHTML = x;                     // Display x in the element
var x; // Declare x

3.	What are the different events in JavaScript or dom?
A JavaScript can be executed when an event occurs, like when a user clicks on an HTML element.
To execute code when a user clicks on an element, add JavaScript code to an HTML event attribute.
onclick=JavaScript
Examples of HTML events:
When a user clicks the mouse
When a web page has loaded
When an image has been loaded
When the mouse moves over an element
When an input field is changed
When an HTML form is submitted
When a user strokes a key
4.	How to attach event listener to an elements?
The EventTarget.addEventListener() method registers the specified listener on the EventTarget it's called on. The event target may be an Element in a document, the Document itself, a Window, or any other object that supports events.
target.addEventListener(type, listener[, options]);
